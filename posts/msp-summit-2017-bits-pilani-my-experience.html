    <div class="post-content">
        <p>July 2017 I applied for the MSP programme not expecting much from it. Along with few other hundreds I got into the programme and did the required.
Then came the MSP summit, I am from Assam so I had to think twice whether to go or not because Pilani was quite far from where I stay. After some thought,
I and my friend, fellow MSP from Assam (Amartya Saikia) decided to go and we bought our travel tickets.</p>
<p>I was not expecting anything from it, I remember on day1 somebody asking &#39;What do you expect from this summit&#39; I literally had no clue at that moment.
I went with the flow for the next two days at the summit.</p>
<p>The organizing team did a tremendous job organizing such a big event, handling so many students is no small deal. Kudos to the BITS Pilani Team.</p>
<h1 id="things-that-i-found-amusing">Things that I found amusing</h1>
<p>I thought it would be a developer conference and we&#39;ll develop something but it was more of a networking and knowledge exchange programme.
It was good. All MSPs were extremely friendly and it was an experience that I surely will remember pretty accurately for a very very long time.</p>
<p>Met so many new people. I really enjoyed the live music and fun, it is something we geeks are usually forbidden to (atleast for me, haha)</p>
<h1 id="things-to-take-away">Things to take away</h1>
<ul>
<li>MSIC is important</li>
<li>Doing your workshops and clicking pictures and uploading them in the group is importanter</li>
<li>Having fun amidst and spreading the love for code is the importantest</li>
<li>Have to work harder to be a better MSP, it does not stop there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft being a corporate company, trying to keep in good touch with students is very nice of them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Will try my best to do all I can being a MSP.
Thanks to Vibhor Sir and fellow MSPs for making this happen and it was quite an experience. :)</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Abhishek Garg, a MSP from Meerut reminded me of a incident in the comments do here it is.</p>
<h2 id="story-time">Story time</h2>
<p>Day 1, We all know Sagar Verma right? the guy with his amazing guitar, voice and the wavy hands.
So after the summit night was over at the clock tower building, Sagar was playing open air acoustic from 1am till 4am under the Vallabhbhai Patel statue. I was there enjoying his music and stories. Had some talk with Rahul Bhaiyya(my mentor msp), It was fun 11/10.</p>
<p>It was 4:30am I reached my hostel and the door was locked from the inside. About 15 MSPs were inside. couldn&#39;t knock as it would wake all up. So there was this register and I started tearing off blank pieces of it and throwing them at a MSP I know from bus. This continued for about atleast 30 minutes.
I thought I&#39;d sleep in the corridor that night(jk). Luckily a MSP was awake and noticed my nuisances, (Abhishek from Meerut) He finally opened the door and I was able to sleep. Slept for 3 hours that day.</p>
<p>MSP Summit gave me so many good memories. thanks everyone!</p>
