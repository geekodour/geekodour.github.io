I met people who are talented beyond my imagination, I loved the kde community and will be contributing to kde. Also, made a lot of new friends. This is my first proper step towards open source, also I came to know about GSoC, and Season of KDE. I'll try participating in every conference and event from now on and also send patches and contributions to many opensource projects. I love opensource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Pradeepto, Wrishiraj, Rahul, Sinny, Srijan, Sunit, Pranav(I would love to call him Puri, Pranav and Suri), Tony, Garvit, and everybody else. It's been real. 
Thankyou! lots of love.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
