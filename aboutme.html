          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>Hi, I am a 20y/o guy from Assam, India. I like to play around with computers, I use arch linux, i love open source, I am learning programming because one day I want to give it back to the community by contributing in the linux kernel. Also, I know enough javascript to get a decent production ready website/webapp going. I've worked with various frameworks. I wish I had time to read the man pages and docs of framework that I use, but I guess that's how it's meant to be, "read it when you need it".
          Right now, I am relearning maths because all of my school life I did the wrong math. I realize the importance of maths now. better be late than never.
       I recently started contributing to open source after I attended conf.kde.2017</p>
          <h2>My open source project contributions</h2>
          <h2>My own projects and client projects</h2>
          Most of my projects were related to server administration, which I can't really show case but here are few web dev related projects.
          I am learning advance python and c these days, so expect some advanced projects in the future(If everything goes according to plan)
          <ul>
                  <li>Innolearn - Uses NLP to generate journal entry from question - Django, React, Redux, Python, JavaScript</li>
                  <li></li>
                  <li></li>
